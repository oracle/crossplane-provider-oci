                            of application dependencies. Every node, even those who
                            share the same GAV, should have a different nodeId. The
                            preferred way of constructing a nodeId is to assign incremental
                            integers during a breadth first or depth first search.

                            referring to the same GAV, that is, a GAV can have multiple
                            transitive dependencies.)
