                                  automatic backups. This value applies to automatic
                                  backups only. After a new automatic backup has been
                                  created, Oracle removes old automatic backups that
                                  are created before the window. When the value is
                                  updated, it is applied to all existing automatic
                                  backups.

                  WriteConnectionSecretToReference specifies the namespace and name of a
                  Secret to which any connection details for this managed resource should
                  be written. Connection details frequently include the endpoint, username,

                  This field is planned to be replaced in a future release in favor of

                  and connection details would be published to both without affecting
                  each other.
