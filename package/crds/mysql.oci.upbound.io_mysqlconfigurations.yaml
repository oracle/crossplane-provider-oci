                            In MySQL 8.0.18 and later, this variable also controls
                            the amount of memory used for hash joins. Normally, the
                            best way to get fast joins is to add indexes. Increase
                            the value of join_buffer_size to get a faster full join
                            when adding indexes is not possible. One join buffer is
                            allocated for each full join between two tables. For a
                            complex join between several tables for which indexes
                            are not used, multiple join buffers might be necessary.

                            values is specified, the thread pool plugin does not load

                            A transaction delay can be used in cases where parallel
                            transactions affect the performance of other operations
                            due to resource contention. For example, if parallel transactions

                            operation, you can configure a transaction delay to reduce
