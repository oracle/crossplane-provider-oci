                      of the Resource between Service Consumer and Service Provider
                      by allowing the Consumer to refer to the Resource with its own
                      identifier, obviating the need to store a local mapping between
                      the local identifier of the Resource and the identifier used
                      by the Service Provider. Each Resource MAY include a non-empty
                      externalId value. The value of the externalId attribute is always
                      issued by the Service Consumer and can never be specified by
                      the Service Provider. The Service Provider MUST always interpret
                      the externalId as scoped to the Service Consumer's tenant.

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
                  through a Crossplane feature flag.
                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
